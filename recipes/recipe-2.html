<header><b>Steps</b></header>
    <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add portobello mushrooms, button mushrooms, and onion. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms release their juices and onion is soft and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour in wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
    <li>Pour in diced tomatoes and cook, stirring, until liquid has slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add pasta sauce, garlic, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce temperature to low and simmer, uncovered, until flavors have blended and desired thickness has been reached, about 15 minutes. Stir sauce occasionally.</li>
