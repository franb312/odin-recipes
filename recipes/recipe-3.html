    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Using fresh mushrooms makes this sauce meaty and filling. The use of your favorite jarred sauce makes it easy. The finished sauce tastes homemade. Use a large pot or Dutch oven. Serve sauce topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese if you like.</p>

<header><b>Steps</b></header>
   
<li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add portobello mushrooms, button mushrooms, and onion. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms release their juices and onion is soft and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour in wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
<li>Pour in diced tomatoes and cook, stirring, until liquid has slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add pasta sauce, garlic, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce temperature to low and simmer, uncovered, until flavors have blended and desired thickness has been reached, about 15 minutes. Stir sauce occasionally.</li>
