    <colgroup><ul><header><b>Ingredients</b></header>
            <li>7 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 onions, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
    </ul></colgroup>
<ol>
<header><b>Steps</b></header>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until softened and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onions into a tagine. Layer chicken pieces on top of onions.</li>
    <li>Combine turmeric, cumin, ground coriander, and salt in a small bowl; mix well with remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil. Spread spice mixture onto the chicken pieces. Add cinnamon pieces, bay leaves, ginger, and cilantro. Pour in 1/2 cup of water and cover tagine with a lid.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li> Melt butter in a skillet over low heat while chicken is cooking. Add sliced pears and honey and cook, while stirring, until honey has caramelized.</li>
    <li>Remove tagine from the oven and stir in caramelized pears. Return to the oven and cook for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
